# Mini-Project-Sem-III
Mini Project for the third semester. Made by Amogh Bharadhwaj and Anish Prasad Gupta.
'Arcade' is a compilation of simple text based games such as TicTacToe, Hangman and 'Who wants to be a millionaire' that we felt was a fair challenge to our knowledge as python developers. We have learnt new skills and implemented the knowledge we learnt at college.
